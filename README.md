# odin-library
The Odin Project's javascript library assignment. Create a simple book reading application that records title, author, pages, and whether it was read.
This implementation is themed after the "MYST" game series, with the background image from "MYST IV: Revelation".

**Requirements:**

- Function (not constructor) that takes user input to store book objects in an array.
- Function that loops through array and displays each book on the page.
- Button that brings up a form that users can add a new book to the library.
- Each displayed book should have buttons to remove itself and change its read status.

**Note to self**

Github's live environment and/or page system requires files to not have "_" at the begining of a file name. Also, it can be sensitive to file paths having a "/" at the begining. After changing the css file's links and "parched_002.png" to "parched002.png" it seems to load properly now. I suspect it was more due to the file path than to the name change.
